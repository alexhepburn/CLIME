TODOS
 - Graphs of comparisions of runs
 - pipeline options to run multiple options for graph comparison (select multiple rather than a dropdown)
 - downsample datasets
 - pipeline option to reduce dataset size instead of sample nums (defualt size for synthic data - slider for class proportions)





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUGS
fix pipeline.get_avg  -> multiple_runs.py

FUTURE
rebalance by under sampling?? (makes different just cost sensitive training)
more ABC for each part of the pipeline (and docs for expected formats)
tests for input error msg in the pipeline


THOUGHTS
 - change lime internals as options rather than fixed methods e.g. can change model, sampling, balancing etc.
