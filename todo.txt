things that still need to be implemented
-------------------------------------------------------------
look into class_proportions in the pipeline to verify it's working as expected

more ABC for each part of the pipeline


balancing data inside the explainer before training
  - change to just sample more from minority class

rebalance by under sampling?? (makes different just cost sensitive training)

lime sampling cov (from data?)
lime features split (from data?)


better pipeline ***************************************************** main.py
  - multiple runs of multipl opts entries
  - compare different pipeline configs - graphs???
