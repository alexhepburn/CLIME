things that still need to be implemented


balancing data inside the explainer before training
  - change to just sample more from minority class

rebalance by under sampling?? (makes different just cost sensitive training)




better pipeline
  - (maybe run an average over multiple runs/data instances)
  - compare different pipeline configs - graphs???
