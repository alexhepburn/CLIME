things that still need to be implemented


balancing data inside the explainer before training
  - change to just sample more from minority class

rebalance by under sampling?? (makes different just cost sensitive training)




better pipeline
  - finish more automatic type pipeline getting method from __init__
  - make generic function in pipeline for getting and calling AVAILABLE_****
  - write tests for all available pipeline params


  - (maybe run an average over multiple runs/data instances)
  - compare different pipeline configs - graphs???
