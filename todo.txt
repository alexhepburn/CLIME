TODOS
 - eval with just key points sampled around gaussian of query point
 - param for weight of LIME balancer
 - situations from mean to boarder0> how does this affect LIME balancer?


 - KL div (fit a Gaussian or other way to compare probabilites?)

 - normalise the datasets (check attributes to see if this is okay to do)

 - Think how to display/illustrate experiments better?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUGS
fix pipeline.get_avg  -> multiple_runs.py


FUTURE
rebalance by under sampling?? (makes different just cost sensitive training)
more ABC for each part of the pipeline (and docs for expected formats)
tests for input error msg in the pipeline


THOUGHTS
 - change lime internals as options rather than fixed methods e.g. can change model, sampling, balancing etc.
