TODOS
 - normalise the datasets (check attributes to see if this is okay to do)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUGS
fix pipeline.get_avg  -> multiple_runs.py


FUTURE
rebalance by under sampling?? (makes different just cost sensitive training)
more ABC for each part of the pipeline (and docs for expected formats)
tests for input error msg in the pipeline


THOUGHTS
 - change lime internals as options rather than fixed methods e.g. can change model, sampling, balancing etc.
