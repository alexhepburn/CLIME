things that still need to be implemented
-------------------------------------------------------------
more ABC for each part of the pipeline

tests for input error msg in the pipeline

fix pipeline.get_avg  -> multiple_runs.py


#### eval added as test set for all expl/evaluations
====== started at german credit (added csv) need to now get data dict from this
  - think how to encorporate other datasets (e.g. adult/credit)
    - might have to remove sample numbers (fix them as defaults for loaders and dont specify them)


balancing data inside the explainer before training
  - change to just sample more from minority class

rebalance by under sampling?? (makes different just cost sensitive training)

lime sampling cov (from data?)
lime features split (from data?)


better pipeline ***************************************************** main.py
  - multiple runs of multiple opts entries
  - compare different pipeline configs - graphs???
