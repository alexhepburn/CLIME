faithfulness (or fidelity) of surrogate and model assumes same decision process
  - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03685.pdf

local fidelity with same weights used to train the surrogate model
  - as the surrogate only aims to be interpreting this region well

(in)fidelity paper:

Research ideas:
show that local weighting of lime helps local fidelity
show class balanced helps class balanced fidelity
show other cost sensitive trained models where you need to do other things for lime (e.g. for boundary adjust we find that you shoudln't do cost sensitive lime for some reason?)
